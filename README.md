# TestEngine GitHub Actions Demo

This repository demonstrates how to use GitHub Actions to:
1. Initiate a ReadyAPI TestEngine instance
2. Run a ReadyAPI project in the TestEngine
3. Poll until the project finishes running
4. Retrieve and store test results in the repository

## Repository Structure

- `.github/workflows/` - GitHub Actions workflow files
- `readyapi-projects/` - ReadyAPI project files
- `test-results/` - Directory for storing test execution results
- `scripts/` - Helper scripts for TestEngine operations

## Getting Started

1. Configure your TestEngine connection details in GitHub Secrets
2. Place your ReadyAPI project files in the `readyapi-projects/` directory
3. Push changes to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow

## Required GitHub Secrets

- `TESTENGINE_LICENSE_KEY` - Your SmartBear License Manager (SLM) access key
- `TE_SLM_SERVER` - (Optional) Custom SLM server URL (leave empty for hosted SLM)

### How to Get Your SLM Access Key:
1. Log in to your SmartBear Account at https://accounts.smartbear.com/
2. Go to Account Settings ‚Üí API Access Keys
3. Create or copy your existing API access key

### How to Add Secrets:
1. Go to your repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Click "New repository secret"  
3. Add `TESTENGINE_LICENSE_KEY` with your SmartBear License Manager access key
4. Optionally add `TE_SLM_SERVER` if using a custom SLM server

**Note:** The `TESTENGINE_LICENSE_KEY` secret should contain your SLM access key, not a direct license key.

### Authentication:
- TestEngine uses SmartBear License Manager (SLM) for license activation
- TestEngine admin user hardcoded as admin/admin (secure for ephemeral containers)
- API calls use admin/admin for basic authentication
- Container is destroyed after each workflow run

### Security Note:
**Admin credentials are hardcoded as admin/admin** for simplicity since:
- Container runs temporarily (minutes) in private GitHub Actions environment
- No persistent storage or external network exposure
- Container is destroyed after each workflow execution

**If you prefer configurable credentials:**
1. Add `TESTENGINE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` to GitHub Secrets
2. Update workflow env vars: `TESTENGINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.TESTENGINE_ADMIN_PASSWORD }}`
3. Update container env: `-e TESTENGINE_PASSWORD="${{ secrets.TESTENGINE_ADMIN_PASSWORD }}"`
4. This provides additional security isolation if running in shared environments

## Features

- **üöÄ Fast TestEngine Setup**: Optimized Docker startup (~1.5-2 min total execution)
- **üîë License Management**: Activates TestEngine license via SLM (SmartBear License Manager)  
- **üìä Project Execution**: Uploads and executes ReadyAPI projects
- **‚è±Ô∏è Smart Polling**: Monitors execution status with timeout protection
- **üìã Multiple Report Formats**: Downloads JSON, JUnit XML, PDF, and Excel reports
- **üíæ Artifact Storage**: Stores test results as GitHub Artifacts (no git commits)
- **üßπ Automatic Cleanup**: Properly cleans up containers after execution
- **‚ö° Performance Optimized**: 50% faster than standard setup (see PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZATIONS.md)

## Report Formats

The workflow downloads test results in multiple formats using the documented TestEngine API:

| Format | Accept Header | File Extension | Use Case |
|--------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| JSON | `application/json` | `.json` | Detailed programmatic analysis |
| JUnit XML | `application/junit+xml` | `.xml` | CI/CD integration & test reporting |
| PDF | `application/pdf` | `.pdf` | Executive reports & documentation |
| Excel | `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet` | `.xlsx` | Data analysis & stakeholder reports |

## How to Access Test Results üì•

After a workflow runs, test results are stored as **GitHub Artifacts**. Here's how to find and download them:

### Step 1: Navigate to Actions
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the **"Actions"** tab at the top
3. Find your workflow run in the list

### Step 2: Access Artifacts  
1. Click on the specific workflow run
2. Scroll down to the **"Artifacts"** section at the bottom of the page
3. You'll see an artifact named like: `readyapi-test-results-20241024_143052`

### Step 3: Download Results
1. Click the artifact name to download a ZIP file
2. Extract the ZIP to access all report formats:
   ```
   readyapi-test-results-TIMESTAMP/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ execution-report-{id}.json      # Detailed JSON results
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ junit-report-{id}.xml           # JUnit XML for CI tools  
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-report-{id}.pdf            # PDF executive report
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-report-{id}.xlsx           # Excel spreadsheet
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ execution-logs-{id}.txt         # TestEngine execution logs
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ download-summary.json           # Download metadata
   ```

### Artifact Retention
- **Retention period**: 30 days (configurable in workflow)
- **Naming**: Includes timestamp for easy identification
- **Size**: Typically 1-10MB depending on test complexity

### Programmatic Access
You can also access artifacts via GitHub CLI or API:
```bash
# Using GitHub CLI
gh run download <run-id> --name readyapi-test-results-TIMESTAMP

# Using GitHub API  
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/artifacts
```

## Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow will:
1. Check out the repository
2. Start a TestEngine Docker container  
3. Wait for TestEngine to be ready
4. Activate TestEngine license via SLM
5. Upload ReadyAPI project to TestEngine
6. Poll for execution completion
7. Download results in multiple formats (JSON, JUnit, PDF, Excel)
8. Store results as GitHub Artifacts
9. Clean up the TestEngine container
