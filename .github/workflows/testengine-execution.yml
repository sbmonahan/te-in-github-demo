  # Hardcoded credentials are safe here because:
  # - TestEngine container runs in isolated GitHub Actions environment (no external network access)
  # - Container is ephemeral (destroyed after workflow completion ~2-3 minutes)
  # - No persistence between runs - fresh container each time
  # - Only used for localhost API calls within the secure runner
