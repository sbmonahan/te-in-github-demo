# Optimized TestEngine Workflow Suggestions

## Current Issues to Address:
1. **Redundant validation step** - health check already validates connectivity
2. **Verbose container startup** - too much debugging for normal operation  
3. **Sequential operations** - npm install could run parallel to container startup
4. **Over-provisioned resources** - 2g/4g JVM might be excessive for CI

## Suggested Optimizations:

### 1. Simplified Container Startup (30s -> 15s faster):
```yaml
- name: Start TestEngine Container
  run: |
    echo "🚀 Starting TestEngine..."
    docker run -d --name testengine -p 8080:8080 \
      -e TESTENGINE_LICENSE_KEY="${{ secrets.TESTENGINE_LICENSE_KEY }}" \
      -e TESTENGINE_PASSWORD=admin \
      -e JVM_OPT_XMS="-Xms1g" -e JVM_OPT_XMX="-Xmx2g" \
      smartbear/readyapi-testengine:latest
    
    echo "⏳ Waiting for TestEngine to initialize..."
    timeout 180s bash -c 'until curl -sf http://localhost:8080/api/v1/version; do sleep 5; done'
    echo "✅ TestEngine ready!"
```

### 2. Parallel Dependency Installation:
```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js & Install Dependencies  
  run: |
    npm install &
    INSTALL_PID=$!
    # Container startup happens here
    wait $INSTALL_PID
    echo "✅ Dependencies installed"
```

### 3. Combined Upload & Execute:
```yaml
- name: Upload and Execute ReadyAPI Project
  id: run-tests
  run: |
    PROJECT="${{ github.event.inputs.project_name || 'te-sample-readyapi-project.xml' }}"
    EXECUTION_ID=$(node scripts/upload-and-execute.js "$PROJECT")
    echo "execution_id=$EXECUTION_ID" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

### 4. Remove Redundant Validation:
Since health check already validates connectivity, we could skip the separate validation step.

### 5. Streamlined Error Handling:
Use shared utility functions to reduce code duplication across scripts.

## Estimated Time Savings:
- **Container startup**: 15-30 seconds (reduced JVM heap + less verbose logging)
- **Parallel npm install**: 10-15 seconds  
- **Removed validation step**: 5-10 seconds
- **Combined operations**: 5-10 seconds

**Total potential savings**: 35-65 seconds per workflow run
